                        <p>Project requirements were to listen to three entirely unrelated audiobook stories. They were unrelated by author, by title, and by subject matter. The design of their book covers, however, were to be cohesive and obvious as created
                            in an identifiable style by one singular designer. Contrary to how most books are typically marketed and sold, these three books were not to have any objects or identifiers to their stories used in the development of their
                            covers. In this play on the phrase “don’t judge a book by its cover,” I set out to make designs that would invite readership without actually revealing the book’s contents. Conceptually their design relates to the idea, though
                            that idea may not be directly clarified.

                        <p>”Patient Zero" is a story who is the initial one who spread epidemic disease. I captured a bowling ball as the initial one and these pins are the ones who got infected. I expressed the impact of hitting a ball to the pins as the
                            feeling of panicked.
