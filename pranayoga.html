                        <p>This was the first opportunity that I create UI design. I created a yoga website on a simple web page. The web page concept was to let the viewer feel the nature of Hawaii and a friendly yoga class. I created some illustrations
                            which are childlike style to express friendliness for this yoga class.

                            feeling in keeping with the historical roots of the city to Mexico and Spain. The color of Santa fe is Brownish black which represents the dirt of adobe building.

                        <p>Shape and colors: In Santa Fe, the predominant architectural style is adobe brick. I provided rounded shapes that are reflective of this. In New Mexico, there are three prominent interlaced cultures: Spanish, Native American, and
                            American. These are expressed in a triptych of shapes, in part referencing religion and Santa Fe’s translated meaning in Spanish as “holy faith.” A subtle negative-space cross shape is found on the right, signifying the rite
                            of historical religious conquests that are both significant and controversial to the history of the people. The 3 colors represent local indigenous crop chili pepper, turquoise stone popular in jewelry, and brown earth used
                            in adobe building.
