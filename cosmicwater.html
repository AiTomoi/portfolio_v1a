                            feeling in keeping with the historical roots of the city to Mexico and Spain. The color of Santa fe is Brownish black which represents the dirt of adobe&nbsp;building.

                        <p>Shape and colors: In Santa Fe, the predominant architectural style is adobe brick. I provided rounded shapes that are reflective of this. In New Mexico, there are three prominent interlaced cultures: Spanish, Native American, and
                            American. These are expressed in a triptych of shapes, in part referencing religion and Santa Fe’s translated meaning in Spanish as “holy faith.” A subtle negative-space cross shape is found on the right, signifying the rite
                            of historical religious conquests that are both significant and controversial to the history of the people. The 3 colors represent local indigenous crop chili pepper, turquoise stone popular in jewelry, and brown earth used
                            in adobe&nbsp;building.
